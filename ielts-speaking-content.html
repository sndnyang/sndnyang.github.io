<p>I'm a  software engineer namely a programmer.  This job really makes me thrilling and I enjoy coding very much.</p>
<p>Certainly it's determined by my major in college . when I studied computer science in my university, I found that it was very suitable for my personality. I can Make full use of my intelligence.</p>
<p>It can make me concentrated, keep making progress by trial and error. The programming skills also give me the power to make some ideas come true.</p>
<p>Sure. I miss the vacation so much of course. But it's more important to apply my knowledge and skills and I know I can learn more in the job.</p>
<h1 id="home">home</h1>
<p>I live in a small room of a flat with 6 bedrooms  2 bathrooms and no kitchen and no living room.  Very small but fortunately with a big French window.</p>
<p>because there is no living room for us to get together, we usually stay in own rooms and don't know each other well.</p>
<p>certainly not, I plan to leave there in the near future.</p>
<p>After my graduation, so it's about 3 years.</p>
<p>The housing is really simple and small with little decoration, even compared to the dormitory in college. And my bedroom of my family house in my hometown is bigger than this one.</p>
<p>living room for chatting and kitchen for cooking. these are where my family spend most of the time.</p>
<p>small about no more than 9 square meters.  Fortunately it has a really big frech window, so the room will be bright and I think dark environment will give some depressing feeling. On the contrary it's so hot during the summer as the room face south.</p>
<h1 id="hometown">hometown</h1>
<p>My hometown is Majiang county, in  Guizhou province, in the sourtwestern part of China.</p>
<p>Majiang county or the entire guizhou province is on the Yungui Plateau. So it has a bad transportation compared to plain area.  However there's a green langscape and little pollution a popular topic in China recently.</p>
<p>about 11 years, from second Grade in primary school until last year before college</p>
<p>well, I love it, a leisure life, a adaptive life there I love the food  though it's not convinient and there is little jobs and  opportunities.  it has a much lower economic and educational level.</p>
<p>Certainly it's not a good place for me a IT programmer. Remote jobs are not the mainstream way in developing.</p>
<h1 id="_1">巧克力</h1>
<p>Yes, I love chocolate. I like the taste gives me a delicious and smooth feeling when I'm eating it. I enjoy it melts in the mouth and some types will leave a bitter feeling stimulating the tongue .wonderful.</p>
<p>In fact I don't know the type of chocolate. I buy it mainly the band Dove without checking its type  and I never find one type can make me disgusted. So I have no idea about my favorite type.</p>
<p>I try not to buy too much. Because I can't help eating all of it. this will be excessive to cause a bad taste.  over the capacity of my tongue</p>
<p>Yes, it's very common to give boxes of sugars and chocolates as a gift especially celebrating sth such as a wedding and Chinese traditional spring festival.</p>
<h1 id="_2">最喜欢的电影</h1>
<p>I want to describe a film A jackie chan's movie named Project A. It's very old, at least older than me because it was on show in Hongkong at 1983 , 9 years before I was born.So obviously I didn't see it at the cinema. Maybe in CCTV6 or just on the Internet. This film Project A is a master work of Jackie Chan in the action movie Field.  Many classical and great Scenarios are integrated into this movie. makes it excellent too. Jackie draws lesson from some stories like an undercover detective tale from a Chinese popular war novel and some world well known movie scenarios such as the falling from the bell tower and the bicycle chasing in the alley.Based on these Ingenious plots,  Jackie chan Fully demonstrated his talent in the movie, humorous actions,  his life-risking spirit and the tacit understanding between he and his friends, even the never death of his role.So this movie not only makes me laugh but also astonish me deeply when I see the scene of falling from the tower. What's more? I think This movie represents the arrival of the peak of action films. No one can surpass it essentially .  So That's why Project A is my favorite movie.</p>
<p>I think from the perspective of the humanities, films can easily express the authors' thinking to the audience. We can know the story  and learn the spirit in the film as Hacksaw Ridge. But it's not for science , engineering and maths even Interstellar,  watching films is for entertainment.</p>
<p>documents from the authority, Parties involved or field survey. Then Documentary films will be more accurate no matter the truth, for entertainment based on the imagination of  to please the audience maybe keeping away from the truth. And some other factors like film language.</p>
<p>love a common kind of film namely romantic love film, besides this, I guess there is a huge difference. For instance, maybe for most men, they will find a war film is powerful, while most girls will not like it.</p>
<h1 id="_3">近期有趣的经历</h1>
<p>I'd like to describe an experience on technology entrepreneur online course. participated in it from january to March 8th lasting 8 weeks. It was offered online by stanford online  and Novoed platform.So hundreds or thousands people were attracted to join it. This course taught us some knowledge on entrepreneur by video and we can share our ideas and ask questions in the forum then ta or other students could answer questions. What's more, The best part of it was that it offered the platform for us to form a team on your own idea to invite other members or join other teams as you like the idea and the goal. After the building of a team, the following steps were writing the bp or bmc, making markets survey, developing a demo according to the course's schedule, at the end, My team was not selected as the top 5 teams that can get to pitch in front of a jury including someone from venture capital. But it was still a really unusual experience, I learned a lot, got feedbacks from other members to drive my project forward. It was a brave breakthrough for me to actively contact to others and express my ideas confidently.</p>
<h1 id="_4">野生动物</h1>
<p>假的都不知道说什么， 还好有真事， 但一只兔子有什么好说的， 中文都无法描述。</p>
<p>it was An interesting story, the first time I saw a real wild animal in the wild. it was a hare or Chinese hare I don't know the academic name  seized by my uncle in a mountain in my hometown.  When I saw it, it was struggling in my uncle's hand with a hurt leg caused by a trap. So the hare's fur was a bit dirty Orinally it was mainly brown. we know the hare has some special features, certainly this hare had all the features too. Long Ears held in the hand.a short tail and small forelegs and larger hind legs powerful and struggling.Even its leg hurt, it still struggled intensely for a while. According to several tales, I tried to feed it with carrots and something else. Of course it ate nothing. It seem that it also knowed that its death was coming. Finally we killed it,and  ate it.  Well It's not an touching story. I never had a feeling like the hare is so cute, I will keep it as the pet or we should free it. Even It was not amazing that the first time I saw a wild animal because just a hare not a tiger. </p>
<h1 id="_5">网站</h1>
<p>My favorite website is Coursera,  the largest mooc platform in the world. Mooc means massive online open courese. It was created in 2013 by two stanford professors. And I knew it immediately because I had paid attention to it for several months. It's a great website, the founders the company invited professors from top universities including nobel prizer to open courses freely accessible for students from all over the world,  Yeah the company also received funding and venture capital to pay for professors and sign contacts with universities. So it covered  all kinds of majors with hundreds of courses. This rich resources attact more than 20 million users . I'm one of them. And I used to visit it everyday for hours Because of the high quality courses. Such as a deep learning course from Hinton the father of deep learning. I can not only improve myself in the professional field but also widen my horizon on many other areas. That's Coursera and the benefits for all of us.</p>
<h1 id="_6">广告</h1>
<p>七喜的精彩蝴蝶效应广告</p>
<p>I'd like to introduce an interesting advertisement maybe I can call it an sci fiction advertisement that impress me deeply . I saw it on a website recently but in fact it was a very old advertisement. at the beginning  a man buys a bottle of beverage and  when he is walking back, the drink is snatched away then a series of coincidences happen to make the Earth be destroyed by the alien. Therefore The astronaut on the moon want to save the world by a time machine. However he fails many times. Last time It seems to be successful by stopping the man buying the beverage, but he is taken to a mental hospital. Out from the hospital, poor and thirsty, He sees a man walking and drinking a beverage. Then he rushes toward to rob the bottle. Yeah, As you may have guessed, the same scenario at the beginning. it's a butterfly effect to advertise the beverage, just a bottle of the beverage can change the world or ruin the world. So this is interesting for two reasons. One is it uses the butterfly effect , very creative. the Other is from the ending it may imply a second meaning that's the future can't be avoided.</p>
<h1 id="_7">高建筑</h1>
<p>从江鼓楼</p>
<p>I'd like to describe a drum-tower in my hometown. the drum-tower is a typical and representative building in my hometown and it has a history more than 300 years. But the one I'll introduce is the tallest one and built in 2005. It locates in a cultral square about 5 kilometers far away from the center of the county. 
This tower is about 45 meters tall,  all of it only use wood or more accurately fir from local.  No cement no steel bar. What's more, it uses a Chinese special traditional structure named mortise and tenon instead of nails. So we should not compare its height to modern buildings. There's no doubt that it becomes a famous place for tourists and also residents.
So it's the symbol of my hometown. And I'm impressed by the art of the building. But I dislike one thing of it. because I'm afraid of heights. although it has a staircase to the top, I dare not to go to the top.</p>
